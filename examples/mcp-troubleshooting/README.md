# üîç MCP Troubleshooting Example

This directory contains a real-world example of using session continuation for a complex troubleshooting scenario.

## üìã Context

**Problem:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers weren't appearing in Warp Terminal despite proper configuration.

**Complexity:** Multi-session debugging involving:
- Configuration file investigation
- System-level diagnostics  
- Multiple potential root causes
- Testing various solutions

## üìÅ Files

### `SESSION_CONTINUATION.md`
The concise continuation file used to pick up exactly where the previous session left off. This is what you'd reference in a new AI session.

### `MCP_TROUBLESHOOTING_STATUS.md` 
Detailed troubleshooting documentation showing the complete investigation process, attempted solutions, and final breakthrough.

## üéØ Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Status Updates**: The continuation file was updated as discoveries were made
2. **Detailed Problem Documentation**: Full troubleshooting process was captured
3. **Solution Implementation**: Once found, the solution was clearly documented
4. **Next Steps**: Clear instructions for continuing after the solution

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Systematic investigation**: Following a logical troubleshooting process
- **Documentation as you go**: Capturing attempts and results in real-time
- **Clear success criteria**: Knowing exactly what "working" looked like
- **Root cause analysis**: Going deeper than surface-level fixes

### Key Breakthrough
The solution came from investigating **system-level configuration** rather than just the obvious config files. The breakthrough was discovering that Warp reads MCP configuration from a different location than expected.

### Template Used
This case primarily used patterns from the **troubleshooting template** (`templates/troubleshooting.md`) but in a simplified format focused on rapid session handoff.

## üéâ Outcome

**Result:** ‚úÖ **SOLUTION FOUND**  
**Root Cause:** Configuration file in wrong location  
**Fix:** Moved configuration to correct Warp Application Support directory  
**Status:** Ready for user verification after Warp restart  

## üîÑ Replication

To use this pattern for your own troubleshooting:

1. Copy `templates/troubleshooting.md` 
2. Adapt it to your specific problem
3. Update it throughout your investigation
4. Create a simple continuation file when switching sessions
5. Commit your progress with descriptive messages

This example shows how effective session continuation can be for complex, multi-step problems that span multiple AI assistant sessions.
