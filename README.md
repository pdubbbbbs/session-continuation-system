## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **For a new project**: Copy the appropriate template from `templates/`
2. **Update project details**: Fill in your specific project information
3. **Commit regularly**: Keep your session status updated with git commits
4. **Reference in new sessions**: Tell your AI assistant to "check session continuation file" or "continue from previous session"

## 📋 Templates Available

### 🔧 Basic Session Continuation (`templates/session-continuation.md`)
- General-purpose template for any project
- Tracks current status, next steps, and key context

### 🐛 Troubleshooting (`templates/troubleshooting.md`)
- Specialized for debugging and problem-solving sessions
- Tracks symptoms, attempted solutions, and breakthrough discoveries

### 💻 Coding Project (`templates/coding-project.md`)
- For software development projects
- Tracks architecture decisions, implementation progress, and technical debt

### 🚀 Deployment (`templates/deployment.md`)
- For infrastructure and deployment projects
- Tracks environment configurations, deployment steps, and operational status

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Context Preservation**: Maintains detailed project state across sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear documentation of what's been completed
- **Problem Documentation**: Captures issues encountered and solutions found
- **Next Steps**: Always know what to do next
- **Git Integration**: Version-controlled session history

## 📖 Usage

### Starting a New Session
```bash
# In your new AI session, simply reference your continuation file
"Please check the session continuation file and continue from where we left off"
```

### During a Session
- Update your continuation file as you make progress
- Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages
- Document any significant discoveries or decisions

### Ending a Session
